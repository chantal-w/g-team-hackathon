# g-team-hackathon
A small collection of games meant for young children for practicing different skills like geography, math, and basic color theory.

How to Use:

Download the game and open it in an IDE. Run the file and follow the instructions given. There are no graphics, all outputs and inputs go to the console.

How it Works:

There is a list of games and you can pick which one to play. For each game, the user is asked for specific inputs whether to fill in a sentence, mix two colors, or some other activity. The code returns information that helps children understand different concepts.

Technology:

We used repl.it and coded in Python. One of the games is a basic calculator and another one was based off of Mad Libs. 

File Structure:

There's only the main method, all of the code is inside it.

Problems:

We had issues coming up with ideas because most of the ideas were too complicated for the team (some of us are new to coding), so we had to come up with a project that would use skills that are easy to learn and/or already somewhat familiar to us. We also decided to create something in an IDE rather than build an app or a website to focus on learning Python.

Issues:

The code isn't as simple as it can be and there is a lot of cyclomatic complexity. Also, there are no visual components to go with each game.

Future Improvements:

We could create more complex games (like a memory matching game) and create visual components so that it's more appealing to the audience that the games are meant for.
